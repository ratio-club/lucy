## lucy

A self-sufficent android designed and built by Steve [Grand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Grand_(roboticist)).

### Background

The commissioning of a machine like the one detailed in 2004s _Growing Up with Lucy_. Cartheur has been working on different constraints in [emotional-toys](https://github.com/emotional-toys) and [machine-intelligence](https://github.com/cartheur/ideal) generally across GitHub, but it seems good at this point in time to implement a recent historical project to learn the unknowns.
